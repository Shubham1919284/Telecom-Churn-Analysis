## 📊 Key Insights

From the analysis, we found that:

  - **Contract Type:** Month-to-month contract holders show the highest churn rates. In contrast, customers with long-term contracts are more loyal.
  - **Service Usage:** Customers without services like online security, tech support, or device protection churn more frequently.
  - **Billing Methods:** Paperless billing and electronic payment methods correlate with higher churn.
  - **Customer Tenure:** New customers are more likely to leave early. Churn probability decreases significantly with longer tenure.

-----

## 📈 Visual Insights

The notebook includes a variety of visualizations, such as:

  - **Churn distribution** across demographics and services.
  - **Correlation heatmaps** revealing relationships between tenure, contract duration, and churn.
  - **Segmented bar charts** highlighting churn influencers.

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

Based on the key insights, we recommend the following strategies to reduce churn:

1.  **Offer incentives** to convert month-to-month customers into long-term contracts.
2.  **Improve technical support**, online security, and device protection offerings to retain customers who value these services.
3.  **Personalize engagement** for paperless billing users with loyalty benefits and tailored offers.
4.  **Design loyalty-driven discounts**, bundles, and add-ons to reward long-term customers and reduce churn.
